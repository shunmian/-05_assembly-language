============================= INTRODUCTION =============================

FUNCTION. The TSR program xPCmouse enables Cursor positioning, Copy and
 Paste in the text modes of PC video cards for DOS programs. Xterm and
 Win95 selection methods are used: word select on double-click, drag
 select, rectangle select. Cursor positioning is supported by three
 methods.

INTERACTION. Programs that use the mouse themselves work as usual and
 ignore the presence of xPC-Mouse. It works in DOS, Windows 3.1 and
 Windows 95.

WINDOWS. Clipboard support is implemented. In this version the xPCmouse
 paste buffer can be transferred to the windows clipboard. The reverse
 works from windows itself (transfer clipboard to keyboard input of the
 DOS box). See WINDOWS below for details.

KERMIT. A useful installation of xPC-Mouse is on a 386SX machine or
 better running MS-kermit 3.xxx over a 14400/28800 baud modem to a
 remote Unix host. Most of the very useful mouse functions familiar to
 Xterm users will be available, especially double-click and paste for
 Unix file names, cursor positioning on the command line, in text
 editors (emacs, ce, jed, joe, jove, vi, pi) and copy/paste of local
 text and remote host text.

PC USAGE. Local use on a PC includes the familiar text capture off the
 screen, paste into a text editor, and copy of file names to be pasted
 on to the command line. The mouse functions are nearly identical to
 those in Xwindow's terminal window Xterm. In Win 3.1 and Win 95 the
 features of xPC-Mouse add Xterm selection, double-click on file names,
 email addresses and net URLs, cursor positioning and append of paste
 text onto a TMP file. The xPC-Mouse paste buffer can be copied to the
 windows clipboard.

SUNPC EMULATOR. This driver can be installed on SUNPC emulators 3.1 and
 later with complete success. It is the only known driver that can add
 local DOS window copy/paste mouse functions to SUNPC windows. Tested on
 SUN4 machines only.

LINUX DOSEMU EMULATOR. This driver can be installed as a replacement for
 the Linux programs "gpm" and "selection" under the DOS emulator called
 "DOSEMU", versions 0.60.4 and later (August 1995) for the Linux
 operating system (386/486 Unix). Not tested on earlier DOSEMU versions.
 Adds cursor positioning to some DOS applications running under DOSEMU.

TEXT EDITORS. Most PC text editors can use xPC-Mouse to position the
 cursor and copy/paste small selections of text. This is especially
 useful in special-purpose editors, like the TeX User's group editor
 called CSED, which uses the Latin II character set. The xPC-Mouse TSR
 works with this editor in text mode. Similar statements apply to
 epsilon, emacs, ce, qedit, jed, joe, pi, and vi clones. The Xterm mode
 can be used with extensible editors to produce a seamless interface to
 the editor's own copy / cut / paste / position functions.


============================ HARDWARE NEEDED ===========================

HARDWARE

  80286, 80386, 80486, 80586, Pentium CPU.
  Microsoft compatible mouse with 2 buttons or
  Mouse Systems compatible mouse with 3 buttons

  Note: The program can be recompiled to work on an 8088 CPU.
        See the ASM source.

============================ SOFTWARE NEEDED ===========================

SOFTWARE

  New mouse device driver MOUSE.SYS or MOUSE.COM. See below for suggestions.
      Normally loaded from the file CONFIG.SYS. See below.
      Mouse driver software is normally provided with mouse hardware.
  MS-DOS compatible operating system
      Tested with MS-DOS 5.0, SoftPC on a SUN4, OS/2 2.x Dos Emulation.
      Tested with DOS 6.2x, DOS 7.0 and WIN 3.1.
      Tested with WIN 95 (limited trial, see installation notes).

CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT

  There must be a line DEVICE=MOUSE.SYS in CONFIG.sys or else a line in
  AUTOEXEC.BAT for the mouse manufacturer's device driver (usually
  called MOUSE.EXE or MOUSE.COM).

  Detect the manufacturer's mouse driver at the DOS level using the
  command "mem /d | more". Search for the keyword MOUSE and memory usage
  of about 15000 bytes.

  With Win 95 the mouse is loaded automatically and you may not change
  it! There are options for DOS and Win 3.1. See below.


ERROR MESSAGES

xPC-Mouse complains if you lack anything essential. The error messages
are explained below in a separate section.

         /?    : Show command switches
         /H    : Show key and button assignments
         /U    : Uninstall

If xPC-Mouse was already installed, or this is the first install, then
the appropriate message is displayed, for example, a first install:

xPC-Mouse, version 1.4: 5-Sept-1998
Copyright (c) 1994-1998 Jrgen G. Weber and G.B. Gustafson
Free for personal use under the Gnu license agreement.

KEYS and BUTTONS         FUNCTION
Drag Mouse 1 ........... Copy text
Double-click Mouse 1 ... Copy word
Mouse 2 ................ Paste text
CTRL-Mouse 2 ........... Paste text + ENTER
RSHIFT-Mouse 2 ......... Paste feature on/off
LSHIFT-CTRL-Mouse 2 .... Append text to TMP file
LSHIFT-ALT-Mouse 2 ..... Paste into Windows clipboard
Mouse 1 ... ............ Position cursor (hold 1/6 sec)
Mouse 3 ................ Carriage return (except /A3)
ALT-Mouse 2 ............ Mouse 3 duplicate
LSHIFT-Mouse 1 ......... Cursor feature on/off
LSHIFT-ALT-Mouse 1 ..... Toggle methods /A1-/A3
CTRL-LSHIFT-RSHIFT ..... Re-install (hold 1 sec)

xPC-Mouse is installed. Use "xPCmouse /U" to un-install.

If you do not use the mouse you will see no sign of xPC-Mouse being
present. When you move the mouse, the mouse cursor appears. It gets
hidden again as soon as the next character is displayed on screen.

xPCmouse won't show up in a color program running on a mono screen or on
a color screen that has the wrong video mode. The DOS commands MODE CO80
and MODE MONO can change the video mode; xpcmouse /M sets mono mode
manually. See also the /X switch for setting cursor colors.


==================== COMMAND SWITCHES AFTER INSTALL ====================

After xPCmouse has been installed, some of the command line options can
be used. They are:

         /U    : Uninstall
         /R    : Re-activate xPC-Mouse
         /N0   : Defeat mouse handler re-install
         /N1   : Re-install mouse handler before exec
         /N2   : Re-install after exit (default)
         /N3   : Re-install before exec and after exit
         /D=X  : Set Xterm character classes from file X
         /F=X  : Append active paste buffer to file X
         /F:X  : Change TMP name c:\tmp\xpcm####.tmp to X

The more frequently used options /K, /A1, /A2, /A3, /P have hot button
assignments, so command line options are not used after install. The
others can't be changed after install, namely /S, /M, /X. The
information commands are always available regardless of the installation
status:

Info:    /C    : Show copyright information
         /D    : Show Xterm character classes
         /?    : Show command switches
         /H    : Show key and button assignments


=========================== COMPILER EXAMPLE ===========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to drag compiler error messages into an editor.

  The compiler is run as an editor shell. The messages appear on the
  screen, but are lost as soon as the editor is re-entered:

  Assembling file:   TEST.ASM
  **Error** TEST.ASM(165) Undefined symbol: MAINEXIT
  **Error** TEST.ASM(190) Undefined symbol: EXITLOOP1
  Error messages:    2
  Warning messages:  None
  Remaining memory:  470k

  Solution: Copy the text needed into the paste buffer using the mouse.
            Pop back into the text editor and paste the copied text into
            a scratch buffer or as comments at the top of the current
            source file. The messages can be analyzed from the
            reference.

========================== DIRECTORY EXAMPLE ===========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to copy a directory listing into an editor.

  Most editors allow a shell to DOS to do a directory, but offer no
  features for pasting the information back into the file being
  edited. With xPC-Mouse, copy the desired text to the paste buffer and
  re-enter the editor. Then paste with the mouse.


=========================== INTERNET EXAMPLE ===========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to cut and paste URL addresses.

  Internet browsers like Lynx and Netscape have the advantage of rapid
  access to information. News readers and Email programs often supply
  essential information like URL addresses (Universal Resource Locator):
  http://www.yahoo.com/. With Windows cut/paste and DOS xPC-Mouse, the
  addresses can be copied and pasted into a file, where they won't get
  lost.


========================= COMMAND LINE EXAMPLE =========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to copy and paste file names onto the command
         line.

  Many command lines take several file names, usually already on the
  screen due to a directory listing.  GNU software like "ls" is useful
  for displaying the filenames in a compact and directly usable format.

  The method used with xPC-Mouse is to DOUBLE-CLICK on a file name. That
  places the file name in the paste buffer. Then press the right mouse
  button to paste onto the command line.


======================== APPEND FILE EXAMPLE 1 =========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to append URL addresses and WEB text onto a
         collection file b:\sites.txt.

Run xPCmouse once from the command line to define the TMP file name to
be b:\sites.txt, as follows:

                        xpcmouse /f:b:\sites.txt

To append the paste buffer onto the end of the file b:\sites.txt,
highlight the area first, then hold down the Left Shift and Ctrl keys,
while pressing Mouse 2 (Right Mouse button on a 2-button mouse).

If the disk is not in the drive, then problems can occur. There can also
be problems trying to write a file to a CD. Such things can be an
accident, like defining the TMP file as /f:xpcm#.tmp. The problem with
this definition is that it takes the default drive. In the case of a CD
you'll hear a BEEP because xpcmouse can't write the file.


======================== APPEND FILE EXAMPLE 2 =========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to append pieces of a diff session onto a
         collection file c:\tc\diffs.txt.

A typical application of "diff" seeks to find the error in the last of
several edits of prog1.c, in the newly edited source prog2.c. After lots
of edits, this can be a real challenge.

A typical "diff" command line is

                     diff -c prog1.c prog2.c | less

where prog1.c and prog2.c are the different versions of the same
program. The program "less" scrolls the text forward and backward,
unlike the standard "more" which scrolls forward only.

Run xPCmouse once from the command line to define the TMP file name to
be c:\tc\diffs.txt, as follows:

                        xpcmouse /f:c:\tc\diffs.txt

The method used examines the output, selecting pieces with the mouse.
The paste buffer is appended onto the end of the file c:\tc\diffs.txt by
holding down the Ctrl and Left Shift keys, while pressing Mouse 2 (Right
Mouse button on a 2-button mouse).

The selection and append operations are repeated until enough pieces are
gathered to identify the error.


======================== APPEND FILE EXAMPLE 3 =========================

Example. Use xPC-Mouse to append URL addresses and WEB text onto a
         collection file b:\sites.txt.

 This example requires an application that can launch a program and
 return. The example used here is kermit.

 Columbia's modem program "kermit" is capable of making a remote
 connection, running lynx (a text-based WWW browser) at the remote site
 and browsing internet pages. Kermit can define a keyboard macro which
 runs a script written in kermit's command language, and this feature
 completely automates the collection of text.

 The advantage of this method is the selective appending of text to a
 particular file. Several files and key definitions are possible.

 From kermit's documentation:

   {\Kxxxx}      Execute macro named xxxx (xxxx can be any name)
   Example: "SET KEY \315 {\Kapf}" puts macro apf on the F1 key.

 Following the documentation, we issue these commands to kermit. To
 completely automate it we can place the commands in the file
 kermit.ini:

    DEFINE apf run xpcmouse /q /f=b:\sites.txt, connect
    set key \315 {\Kapf}

 During the kermit session, the mouse is used to double-click and
 highlight text. When the text is to be saved in "sites.txt", then key
 F1 is pressed. Each keypress saves the active pastebuffer in xPCmouse
 onto the end of the file "b:\sites.txt".

=========================== MOUSE OPERATIONS ===========================

    HIGHLIGHT text by dragging the left button.

To select a text area move the mouse cursor to the beginning of the
area. Depress and hold button 1 while dragging the mouse over the area
you want to select. When you release button 1, the selected text is
copied to xPC-Mouse's internal buffer. The internal buffer is
overwritten on each use.

  Initial press of Mouse 1 starts a definition and mouse release ends
    it. The highlighted area is determined by the movement of the mouse
    cursor (the drag point). Drags from the initial point to the HOME
    position on the screen define a rectangular area (matrix). All other
    drag directions produce the default Xterm highlight.

  Xterm drags of the mouse highlight the text as in older versions 1.0
    and 1.1 of xPCmouse. It works on one line by dragging in either
    direction. On multiple lines, all characters between the initial
    press and the drag point are highlighted. Lines between the initial
    line and the drag point line are completely highlighted. Mouse
    release copies the region into the paste buffer.

  Matrix drags create a rectangular highlighted area. The method for
    highlighting a box is to press the mouse on the LOWER RIGHT corner
    of the box, then drag the mouse toward the screen's HOME position
    (upper left corner). Mouse release copies the box into the paste
    buffer.

  Blanks on the end of a line are removed. So are unprintable
    characters, those with ASCII codes less than 32. The last line
    highlighted is not stripped of ending blanks. All ASCII codes 32
    through 255 are copied to the paste buffer.


    DOUBLE-CLICK on the left button highlights one word.

If the mouse cursor is on a word, then it can be selected by double
clicking button 1 (the left button). A word is a sequence of letters,
digits, the underline character and European special letters (IBM ASCII
values 80h to 0a5h, 0e0h to 0ebh). This TSR has been coded to accept
most Unix file names, email addresses and URLs. There is a command line
option to change this default behavior.


    PASTE the highlighted text by clicking the right button.

Press the right mouse button to simulate the content of the buffer being
typed at the keyboard. If you keep the CONTROL key pressed while
pressing the right button, an additional pressing of ENTER is simulated.
If you forget the CONTROL, then add ALT-BUTTON2 to inject the missing
carriage return (good for adding blank lines, too).


    PASTE the highlighted text to the TMP file.
    Hold down CTRL-LSHIFT and then click the right button.

The text is appended to the TMP file, set by default to the name
c:\tmp\xpcm####.tmp. If the file cannot be created, then a BELL sounds.
Otherwise the text is appended to the file plus a carriage return and
linefeed at the end. Change the default name with command line option
/f:X where X is the new name (20 char max).

    PASTE the highlighted text to the windows clipboard.
    Hold down ALT-LSHIFT and then click the right button.

The text replaces the current clipboard, all previous text in the
clipboard is lost. If windows is not running, or another windows
application controls the clipboard, then a BELL sounds. Otherwise the
transfer is probably successful. The transfer is made even in the case
where it is incomplete.


    CARRIAGE RETURN is emitted by clicking the middle button.

Press ALT-Button 2 or the middle mouse button to simulate a carriage
return being typed at the keyboard.


    SET CURSOR by pressing the left button 1/6 second.

If you press and release the left button without selecting an area the
cursor is positioned to that location, by stuffing the keyboard buffer
with appropriate arrow keys. However, the press must be 1/6 second or
longer before release, or nothing happens. This is how double-click is
distinguished from just a left button press intended to position the
cursor.


    TOGGLE the set cursor feature by pressing LSHIFT left button

The set cursor function can sometimes send unwanted characters to a
program. Hold down the SHIFT and press the left button, then release
both, to toggle the feature on/off. Copy and paste will work with the
set cursor function defeated. To disable cursor features at startup, use
the /K option on the command line (see below).


    TOGGLE the paste feature by pressing RSHIFT right button

The paste function can sometimes send unwanted characters to a program.
Hold down the RSHIFT and click the right button, to toggle the feature
on/off. Cursor positioning functions will still work with the copy/paste
functions defeated. To disable the copy/paste at startup, use the /P
option on the command line (see below).


    TOGGLE the /A1-/A3 options by pressing LSHIFT-ALT left button

These methods can be selected at startup (/A1 is the default). Some
remote applications may not use the method effectively, e.g., menu
systems such as found in GOPHER on the internet will not respond
properly to /A1 or /A3. The options are toggled one at a time in the
order
                      /A1 --> /A2 --> /A3 --> /A1

The methods /A1-/A3 can be disabled by the /K option on startup or
changed dynamically by pressing LSHIFT button 1.


    Transmit Button 3 by pressing ALT button 2

Some remote applications may need a third mouse button press. Even if
you only have a 2-button mouse, this is possible. The third button on a
3-button mouse (usually the middle button) does the same thing as ALT
button 2.

    Re-install the mouse handler

The HOT BUTTON combination which does a re-install on the fly is

            Right Shift  (1/10 second), then
            Ctrl + Left Shift + Right Shift  (for 1 second).

The right shift key initiates a timer, so when you press it for 1/10 of
a second, then the timer is reset to zero. The method is to touch RSHIFT
and release. Then hold down CTRL and LSHIFT, reach across the keyboard
and press RSHIFT for 1 second. It works if the mouse cursor comes alive.


DE-SELECTION. The selected area is de-selected as soon as you press the
left key again or if anything is displayed on the screen. This is done
because the programs you run don't know anything about the selection.
The de-selecting is done to prevent chaos on the screen. Optical harm
may be caused by xPC-Mouse running together with programs that use page
swaps to achieve fast refresh. It's not dangerous.

MOUSE SUPPORT. If a program offers mouse support itself the mouse
functions of xPC-Mouse lay dormant until the program ends. Clearly not
both can run at the same time, so xPC-Mouse is put in the background by
such programs. After the program exits, xPC-Mouse comes alive again. If
it does not come alive, "xpcmouse /r" should restart it. If that fails,
then "xpcmouse /u" will unload the program so you can load a fresh copy.
Check out the mouse driver recommendations before you decide that it is
the fault of an application or xPC-Mouse. Some video problems can also
lead to a vanishing mouse cursor. For example, WP 6.0 can exit with a
video mode that hides the mouse cursor (fixed by "mode co80").


=========================== COMMAND LINE OPTIONS ==========================

         /U    : Un-install xPC-Mouse
               Removes mouse driver from memory and resets all affected
               interrupt vectors. Finally, it resets the manufacturers
               mouse driver.

         /Q    : Quiet: no messages
               All messages omitted on startup.

         /R    : Re-activate xPC-Mouse
               Some programs reset the manufacturers mouse driver and
               un-vector previous mouse programs, but exit back to DOS
               in an unusual way, undetected by xPC-Mouse. So this
               manual reset of xPC-Mouse exists. This reset will be
               required after exit from programs that grab the mouse, if
               you issue the /N0 or /N1 switch. These switches de-activate
               a mouse handler re-install on exit (/N2 switch).

               The HOT KEY combination which does /R on the fly is

                  Right Shift (1/10 second), then
                  Ctrl + Left Shift + Right Shift (for 1 second).

         /Sabc : Swap buttons 123 to order abc
               Two and three button mouse hardware can be configured for
               left or right hand use and compliance with Unix standards
               for labeling of buttons. To swap the left and right
               buttons on a 2-button mouse, use /S213. To make a
               3-button mouse behave like it does in Unix Xterm, use
               /S132 (right-handed mouse) or /S231 (left-handed mouse).

               Three-button hardware must be supported by a mouse device
               driver that can use Mouse Systems Corporation mode (MSC
               mode in the literature; MS is Microsoft mode). Secondly,
               the 3-button hardware must be installed as such (the
               default seems to be MS mode!). See the notes above on
               installation.

         /Xddd : XOR screen mask ddd (default /X80)
               The highlight of a screen area is indicated by XORing the
               attribute bytes with ddd=80, to de-select they are simply
               XORed again. Normally the XOR mask is 80. A useful one
               for monochrome is /X119. With /X0 you get no visible
               selection. Some people like /X78 the best.

         /Bdddd: Buffer size ddd bytes
               The buffer size can be set to any size less than the
               pre-compiled size. The syntax "xPCmouse /B1536" sets the
               buffer size to 1536 bytes. To use the default
               size, 2048 bytes, no command line option is required. A
               common setting is "xPCmouse /B0 /P" which reduces the
               paste buffer size to 0 and defeats all pasting
               operations. Memory use is reduced by 2k. The maximum buffer
               size is 4096 (recompile the ASM source if you wish).

         /M    : Monochrome video mode
               Same as /X119. Works on Hercules mono cards.

         /N0   : Defeat mouse handler re-install
         /N1   : Re-install mouse handler before exec
         /N2   : Re-install mouse handler after exit (default)
         /N3   : Re-install before exec and after exit
               The int 21h features might interfere with certain software.
               For example, multiple DOS windows in Win 3.1 can compete
               for the mouse handler (but this may not bother you).

               If you use /N0 or /N1, then a re-run of xpcmouse with the
               /R command line switch may be required to re-install the
               mouse handler. The hot button sequence CTRL-LSHIFT-RSHIFT
               for one second will have the same effect as /R. Or, run a
               non-mouse program to jump-start xPC-Mouse.

               Option /N1 schedules a reset with each program execution,
               which is detected through function 4b00h in interrupt
               21h. The actual reset happens on the next timer event
               (18.2 per second). The intent of this option is to handle
               the case of launching a non-mouse program in order to
               have xPCmouse available in that application. If used with
               a mouse application, it is possible that xPCmouse could
               steal mouse control.

               Option /N2 (default) schedules a reset after a normal
               program exit (interrupt 21h functions 0 and 4c). Abnormal
               exits, such as a jump to address zero, will escape
               detection. The actual reset happens on the next timer
               event (18.2 per second). The purpose of this option is to
               reload xPCmouse on exit from a mouse application,
               especially so that it is available for command.com.

               Option /N3 schedules an auto reset before each program
               load (interrupt 21h function 4b00), and a reset is
               scheduled after each program exit (interrupt 21h
               functions 0 and 4c). In either case, the actual reset
               happens on the next timer event (18.2 per second). They
               could happen at the same time. This option is known to be
               trouble for windows, because the /N1 part can occur after
               a program has loaded it's mouse handler, causing the
               mouse features in that program to be lost. In DOS, there
               is less opportunity for conflicts.

               These flags can be reset on the fly by running xpcmouse
               from the command line. For example, a batch file to run
               windows could set /N2 in xpcmouse and then invoke windows
               3.1. Windows 95 cures the ills of the /N switches by not
               allowing xPCmouse to be pre-loaded in DOS (load it in
               each DOS box individually).

         /K    : Defeat Arrow key emulation
               The left button pressed for 1/6 second normally produces
               a stuffing of arrow keys to reset the text cursor to the
               button press location. This command line option causes
               xPC-Mouse to start up with that feature defeated. Holding
               the LSHIFT key down and pressing the left button toggles
               the /K state on/off.

         /P    : Defeat pastebuffer use
               Some applications will not allow pasting, since the
               application does it already in response to Xterm
               sequences that emulate the mouse buttons. Also used to
               simplify logic for paste buffer size 0 (see /B0).

         /A1   : Emacs/vi arrow key method (default)
         /A2   : Matrix arrow key method
         /A3   : Xterm escape sequence method
               The matrix method positions the cursor by moving it by
               columns first, then by rows. The Emacs method moves the
               cursor first to column 0, then the matrix method is
               applied. This prevents false positioning due to emacs
               character-stream notions of "point". Also works in VI,
               JOVE and JED. The Xterm method sends escape sequences
               recognized by Xterm as simulations of the mouse. Many
               editors already recognize the escapes, but may need
               additional support to make full use of the information.
               The Xterm support is the best for modem use. See the
               technical notes below for more detail.

         /D=X  : Set Xterm character classes from file X
               The file should have one line, less than 128 chars, in
               the format
               35-35:45-58:64-90:92-92:95-95:97-122:126-126:128-165:224-238

               For example, the section 64-90 stands for '@' plus the
               uppercase characters 'A' to 'Z'. Space is reserved for 12
               pairs (only the first 12 are used).

               A classic use for this feature is in Lotus 123. The
               material in a spreadsheet can be matched with the
               double-click function for pasting text into cells.

         /F=X  : Append active paste buffer to file X
               The symbol X is replaced by a valid DOS path name,
               e.g., syntax /F=b:\tmp\foo.txt appends the current paste
               buffer to the file b:\tmp\foo.txt, creating the file if
               it does not already exist. Name limit is 128 characters.

         /F:X  : Change TMP file c:\tmp\xpcm####.tmp to X.
               The symbol X is replaced by a valid DOS path name, e.g.,
               syntax /F:b:\tmp\foo.txt changes the default name to
               b:\tmp\foo.txt, creating the file if it does not already
               exist. The actual pasting to the file is done with the
               hot button combination CTRL-LSHIFT-BUTTON 2. A BELL
               sounds if the file cannot be created. Name limit is 20
               characters.

         /C    : Display copying information
               Prints the author addresses, email addresses and
               copyright information for the GNU license agreement.

         /D    : Show Xterm character classes.
               Shows Xterm classes in the format
                Xterm Classes
                35-35:45-58:64-90:92-92:95-95:97-122:126-126:128-165:224-238

               For example, the section 64-90 stands for '@' plus the
               uppercase characters 'A' to 'Z'. See an ASCII chart.

         /?    : Display help text
               Actually, any nonsense on the command line causes help to
               be printed as does any command line containing a question
               mark.

         /H    : Display mouse button assignments
               This display can be obtained without loading the TSR. By
               default, it is displayed if the driver is already
               resident, since in this situation, mouse button
               information is more relevant than command line switches.


========================== MONOCHROME CARDS ===========================

On monochrome systems (Hercules compatible cards) you could try option
/X119 to produce a visible selection on screen. The special option /M is
a synonym for /X119. If the command line has no /X or /M options, then a
check is made for for video mode 7 (mono monitor). If found, then the
TSR selects /M automatically.

So switches /X119 or /M are useful only if the computer fools the
software and you need a manual over-ride. This happens, for example, on
laptop computers with mono EGA/VGA. The check for text mode 7 will not
be successful on such hardware.

  BUTTON CONVENTIONS.
          A 2-button mouse (Microsoft) has a Left button and a Right
          button. A 3-button mouse (PC Mouse Systems) has a Left button,
          Right button and Middle button. The physical layout is not
          important, because xPC-Mouse allows the buttons to be
          swapped. Our discussion here assumes a right-handed mouse
          (otherwise it would be completely confusing to read) and the
          configuration below for a Unix workstation using Xterm
          conventions for the mouse buttons. To understand "button1" and
          "button3", consult the ++second++ diagram, not the first!

          If you work at a Unix console, then consider remapping the
          mouse keys from order 123 to 132 (3-button PC Mouse Systems
          only). Do this via the /S command line switch in xPC-Mouse.
          If you are left-handed, then swapping buttons is not a new
          idea. Be aware that windows settings are unaffected.

 CONFIGURATION FOR 3-BUTTON MOUSE.
 Most of the cheap mice with 3 buttons are just fine. I bought one for
 9.95. It came with a diskette of software and documentation. It is
 installed in autoexec.bat with a line like

        loadhigh c:\mouse\mouse.com /c2

 which specifies COM2 for the port. Everything else is configured by the
 driver and I needed to do NOTHING. When first installed it came up as
 "Microsoft Mouse". And it worked fine as a 2-button mouse. Following
 the instructions with the mouse, I shut off the power, then held down
 the left mouse button as the power was turned on. After the machine
 booted, I released the mouse button. By then, the screen had said
 "Mouse Systems Mouse" installed. Later, I learned the same could be
 accomplished by pulling the mouse connector and holding down a button
 while the connector was re-plugged.

 In short, there are no mouse driver switches to set in order to get the
 3-button mouse to act like one. No changes are made to the device
 driver command line.

 But Microsoft windows 3.1 already had its mind made up that the mouse
 was a "Microsoft Mouse". So I had to run win 3.1 setup. That took some
 time. If I was clever, then I would just edit the INI file in the
 \windows directory to effect the change. At the time, I didn't know
 what win 3.1 had to replace to get everything to work with a different
 kind of mouse device. On the second round, Win 3.1 had both the MS and
 MSC drivers installed and then the swap of drivers was just a reboot of
 windows (very fast).

 The MSC setting didn't last with this cheap mouse. When I turned the
 computer on again, the mouse came up as a Microsoft mouse. In Win 3.1,
 this is a surprise, because the mouse is unavailable. I learned that
 removing the mouse cable from the serial port, holding down button 1,
 and re-installing the cable restored MSC mode in windows (10 seconds).
 This lasted until the power was cycled. To get the DOS mouse driver
 reset to MSC mode required a soft reboot of DOS. All this confusion
 with MS and MSC mode finally caused me to accept MS mode and forget
 about the 3-button mouse. The lesson: get a 3-button mouse that can be
 hardware locked to MSC mode.

===================== LINUX DOSEMU SOFTWARE NEEDED =====================

 The Linux DOS emulator is "DOSEMU", versions 0.60.4 and later (August
 1995) for the Linux operating system (386/486 Unix). To make xPC-Mouse
 work in this environment, a suitable mouse device driver is required.

 Tested and working:
   Genius 10.10 (1988-1992) KYE Sys "gmouse.com",
   Agiler Mouse 7.02 (1991) "mouse.com".
   AmHi Tech [Jow Dian] 8.20 (1994-95) "mouse.com" ,
   Microsoft 8.20a (1992) "mouse.com" (Win 3.1 Distribution disk, MS mode only)

 Tested and don't work:
   Aero 1.30 (1990) ICA tech "amouse.com",
   Austin 6.00 (1993) "mouse.com",
   Romart (1992-93) Mitsumi 7.21 "mouse.com",
   Znix 7.04f (1991) "mouse.com"

 To bring up xPC-Mouse under "DOSEMU", after DOSEMU has been installed
 under Linux, edit the file /etc/dosemu.conf (a Linux file) and change
 the mouse setup to allow an external mouse driver (it might be that
 dosemu is using the internal Linux mouse driver). Launch "dos" and edit
 the file AUTOEXEC.BAT, inserting a mouse driver line and then another
 line for xPC-Mouse. Example for COM2 and a right-handed 3-button mouse
 with buttons swapped to match Xterm assignments:

   dosemu c:\autoexec.bat:
     :dosemu
     PATH H:\DOS;c:\dos;c:\usr
     LH gmouse.com 2 >nul:
     LH xpcmouse.exe /S132 /q
     echo "Welcome to dosemu 0.60 Edit 4.5 (/var/lib/dosemu/hdimage)!"


 A dosemu tip: Set up the console in /etc/dosemu.conf to reflect the
 actual hardware (VGA, mono, etc). Use a RAW keyboard. Suspect this
 setup error if the mouse cursor does not appear.


 XDOS INTERFACE. Under Linux running Xfree86 (X-windows), an ansi Xterm
 window is suitable for running DOSEMU. In that window, DOS applications
 can be launched.

 A special interface known as XDOS is available for creating a suitable
 Xterm window and launching DOSEMU in that window. The mouse interface
 in this setup is known to work from the point of view of Xwindows. It
 does not work from the point of view of a DOS program. In the case of
 xPCmouse, the XDOS interface results in two copies for each paste
 request. Mouse drags work in XDOS if they happen to agree with Xterm's
 idea.

====================== WINDOWS 3.1 INSTALLATION ========================

  In Win 3.1, xPCmouse provides a clipboard among the various DOS
  applications running in Windows. All the DOS windows have to share the
  same clipboard, so it is most convenient to load xPCmouse **BEFORE**
  starting Windows:

                loadhigh xpcmouse /a2 /q
                win

  With the right mouse device driver (configured in config.sys or
  autoexec.bat), several DOS windows (windowed or full screen) can run
  in 386 enhanced mode, each with its own mouse interface. If the
  application does not hook the mouse, then xPC-Mouse runs. If it does
  hook the mouse (e.g., Microsoft EDIT), then xPC-Mouse goes idle until
  that application exits. Applications that can use xPC-Mouse will share
  the paste buffer, for copying text between windowed DOS programs.

  For example, if you like to run kermit from Windows and want xPC-Mouse
  to be there, then load xPC-Mouse from the DOS prompt before entering
  kermit. Items appearing in the kermit window can be safely and
  efficiently appended to the TMP file. The default name of the TMP file
  is "c:\tmp\xpcm####.tmp". It can be changed on the fly from the
  xPCmouse command line.

  Direct paste of the xPCmouse highlighted text into the windows
  clipboard is possible in Win 3.1. The clipboard is viewed with
  c:\windows\clipbrd.exe. The transfer is not completely foolproof.
  Errors in the transfer, such as some other windows application owning
  the clipboard, cause the bell to sound. No bell means it worked.

  To switch to full screen mode in Win 3.1 or Win 95, and back again to
  Windowed mode, press ALT-ENTER on top of the DOS box. The Win 95
  behavior is decidely different, but usable.

  If you use DOS 6.2 and Win 3.1 in MS mouse mode, with a Win 3.1
  video driver, then xPC-mouse is activated by moving the mouse cursor
  into the DOS window. It is active in both windowed mode and full
  screen mode. With MSC mouse mode, the feature sometimes vanishes.
  Reminder: MS == Microsoft mode, MSC == Mouse Systems Corporation mode.

  If you use Windows video drivers made before the release of Win 3.1,
  then likely xPC-mouse will not be available in a Win 3.1 DOS window.
  You can use still use it in full-screen mode (ALT-ENTER is the mode
  toggle in Win 3.1). A free fix exists for this problem: use a Win 3.1
  video driver or one made for the video card at a later date by the
  manufacturer. Microsoft (http://www.microsoft.com/) has made freely
  available an accelerated win 3.1 super VGA driver set "svga.exe" (a
  compressed auto - extracting archive) for the Tseng, Trident and
  standard 256-color VGA cards (1994).

  Mouse button swaps in Win 3.1 affect the mouse in windows mode only,
  not in a DOS window. If you want xPC-Mouse to match the windows order
  of buttons, then set the command line switch /S (explained below).

  There is a problem with a DOS box contending for the mouse device.
  If one window uses xPC-Mouse and another uses its own mouse interface,
  then exit of one of the programs will cause xPC-Mouse to reset. If
  done in the right order, it can kill a private mouse interface. An
  example: Run a DOS shell in one window, and Microsoft EDIT in another.
  If you exit the DOS shell, then EDIT will lose its mouse features (but
  pick up those of xPC-Mouse). The /N1 switch will turn this behavior
  off, at the expense of having to issue "xpcmouse /r" (or a key
  sequence CTRL-LSHIFT-RSHIFT) when the mouse features go away. Is the
  default behavior /N2 more convenient? In DOS, the answer is definitely
  YES. In windows, /N1 can work best, depending on how the applications
  are used. If you use windows exclusively, and basically just launch
  non-mouse DOS applications from an icon, then set /N1 on the command
  line. If you are using xPCmouse in a COMMAND.COM shell, then option
  /N2 is the best choice.

  Application note: It is possible to restart xPCmouse when another
    application has hooked the mouse (CTRL-LSHIFT-RSHIFT). It doesn't
    always work. But if it does, then it's a one-way install, unless you
    can trick that application into re-installing its mouse program.
    (It turns out that WP 6.0 for DOS can be tricked by a shell to DOS).

  WINDOWS CLIPBOARD SUPPORT. The DOS paste buffer can be transferred to
  the windows clipboard. The reverse process, transferring the windows
  clipboard into the DOS box keyboard input, is handled by windows
  itself (there is no need for xpcmouse to support it).

  One word of warning. The windows API replaces the current clipboard on
  each write. The old clipboard is lost. The function won't work if
  another program is using the clipboard.

     Example: Locate some text in a DOS editor, eg, a modem
              initialization string from modem.ini, then paste
              the selected text directly into the windows clipboard.
              Jump to Telnet and paste the text into a remote text
              editor on a Unix system.

  DOSCLIP. At http://www.coast.net/SimTel/ you will find in the DOS
  section a file "dosclip*.zip" that contains the 1992 source and
  executable for a dos TSR that provides Windows clipboard transfers
  to and from DOS applications running in a "dos box". This is a 10k
  DOS application with ASM sources.


======================= WINDOWS 95 INSTALLATION ========================

  Why bother to install xPCmouse in Win 95? True, Win 95 has a copy and
  paste function built-in. What Win 95 doesn't have in it's DOS box is
  cursor positioning, double-click on file names and Xterm highlighting.
  The one feature I use the most in Win 95 is the append of highlighted
  text onto a TMP file.

  The basics:

    1. Boot win 95.
    2. Start a DOS box (e.g., COMMAND.COM).
    3. Issue the command XPCMOUSE in that window.
    4. Open PROPERTIES on the upper menu bar. Select MISC and set
       EXCLUSIVE for the mouse. Save.
    5. Try out xpcmouse. To escape EXCLUSIVE mode press ALT-SPACE or
       ALT-TAB (returns the mouse to win 95).
    6. Enter EXIT at the DOS prompt to close the DOS box and get rid of
       xpcmouse.

  Limited testing has been done with Win 95. The DOS box in win95 has
  been much improved, allowing more setup options than in 3.1. A big
  change in win95 is the pre-loading of mouse drivers. Microsoft demands
  that you use the windows mouse driver, not an addon DOS driver, when
  booting Win 95 or running DOS box applications. Unlike Win 3.1, the
  supplied Microsoft Win 95 mouse driver works.

  EXCLUSIVE mode must be used for the mouse in the DOS box. This mode is
  set in the PROPERTIES dialog under MISC, accessed from the DOS box
  menu bar (any of the three icons on the top right will work; I used
  letter "A"). Win 95 remembers this setting, and in turn, you must
  remember ALT-SPACEBAR and ALT-TAB as the methods for escaping the DOS
  box and grabbing the mouse back for Win 95 use.

                  *=================================*
                  |     ALT-SPACEBAR and ALT-TAB    |
                  |   Return the Mouse to Win 95!   |
                  *=================================*

  A warning about "msdos mode" in win 95. The result is maybe not what
  you want. It takes about 8 minutes to boot into DOS in this mode and
  then return to Win 95. It is good for about one application in a
  thousand, and I don't know of any that require it.

  To load xPCmouse in a Win 95 DOS box, issue this command at the DOS
  prompt in that box:

                        loadhigh xpcmouse /q

  In general, xpcmouse has to be loaded via a batch file in Win 95,
  instead of being loaded once and for all in autoexec.bat. Luckily,
  every DOS box is able to read in a batch file on startup, given in the
  PROGRAM dialog in the PROPERTIES section. If you don't use the batch
  file approach, then manual loading of xPCmouse is required.

  Other issues like TMP file name, copying to the clipboard, swapping
  buttons and the like all work in Win 95 the same as Win 3.1.

  The default /N2 switch is the best under Win 95. Programs that use the
  mouse are given it by Win 95, and then on exit, xPCmouse again gets
  re-installed automatically, so it is available at the command.com
  level.

  On a 1994 GateWay 2000 computer (486DX-66) running Win 95, the mouse
  seemed lively and responsive. It had a Microsoft BUS mouse. All
  features were active. On a 1997 Pentium 150 from OfficeMax (an
  off-brand whatever), the mouse seemed lethargic in a DOS box, almost
  like software task switching in Win 95 was several steps behind the
  mouse motion. The problems are largely cosmetic. If you can ever get
  the area highlighted, then xPCmouse has squirreled away the text in
  its buffer.


========================== CONFIG.SYS MENU =============================


MAKING WIN 95 BEHAVE LIKE WIN 3.1.

  Why? The default action of Win 95 out of the box is to boot directly
  into Win 95. This behavior is of limited use because it leaves the use
  of old software at the whim of Win 95. Lots of old software runs best
  with a DOS boot. Since Win 95 can be started after the boot, the
  option of DOS or Win 95 on boot is of considerable convenience.

  Edit the file c:\msdos.sys, which is a text file in Win 95, and change
  the line "BootGUI=1" to "BootGUI=0" (that's right, change the "1" to a
  "0").

  Then a cold boot will start up on a config.sys menu. There are
  examples in the DOS help program which show how to set up a menu which
  triggers after so many seconds to a default item on the menu. That
  item might be DOS instead on Windows. Below is a config.sys that is
  known to work in Win 95. You should merge your current one with this
  one to arrive at a working copy.

  The menu items below allow allow for a boot to DOS, Win 95, Linux, a
  special DOS-extender setup for Maple, a special DOS setup for a
  parallel LapLink cable to another DOS computer, for backup and restore
  of software.

=========================== TECHNICAL NOTES ============================

KEYBOARD STUFFING /A1 AND /A2.
Cursor keys are stuffed into the keyboard by options /A1 and /A2.
Precisely, the scan codes for these keys are stuffed. Logic is applied
to keep from over-running the keyboard buffer. There are 4 cursor key
scan codes possible. Option /A1 tests to see if the target row is the
same as the present text cursor row. If it isn't, then the text cursor
is first moved to column 1. Option /A1 then moves by the MATRIX METHOD:
move the cursor to the target row, then to the target column. Option /A2
is /A1 with the normalization to column 1 removed; it is the matrix
method.


KEYBOARD STUFFING /A3.
In option /A3, X-Windows X10 compatibility mode is assumed. However,
no escape sequences from DECSET 9 are sent to the host. That is left
to the host program or the user. We stuff an escape sequence on each
button press encoding the location and the mouse button pressed. In this
mode, we assume the keyboard buffer is emptied quickly, in order to
simplify the logic for stuffing 6 or 12 scan codes at once. We don't
know how this works in practice across all machines, let us know!

On button press, xPC-Mouse in mode /A3 sends ESC [ M Cb Cx Cy, a total
of six characters, 12 bytes of scan code data.  The variables are as
follows:
               Symbol   Coding Rules

               Cb       32 == Button 1 [left button]
                        33 == Button 2 [middle button]
                        34 == Button 3 [right button]

               Cx       32+X, X == mouse row, 1 <= X <= 25

               Cy       32+Y, Y == mouse column, 1 <= Y <= 80

Example: Char   Decimal  Coded Info

         ESC     27      Lead-in byte1
         [       91      Lead-in byte2
         M       77      Lead-in byte3
         !       33      Button 2
         *       42      Row 10
         U       85      Col 53

On a PC with 2-button mouse, the middle button is missing, only left and
right are present. Under SUNPC, the Unix 3-button mouse is converted
into a two-button mouse [left,middle] and therefore button assignment is
VERY confusing. On a Mouse Systems PC mouse, there is a middle button,
but it better described as a 3rd button. If we find a good way to deal
with the various button configurations, then we will update xPC-Mouse
accordingly.

Mouse DRAG holds down the left button with release in a new location.
This results in two escape sequences, the first for button 1 at the
location where the drag began, and the second for button 3, at the
location of release. This sequence can be done without dragging by
pressing button 1 and then ALT-button 2 (alias for button 3, for
2-button mouse).

The (obsolete) Xterm X10 standard for highlighting a region uses a press
of button 1 followed by a press of button 3. During this marking stage,
no highlight appears. Editors like Emacs make use of this method under
X-Windows, but indeed highlight the text upon receipt of the button 3
escape. Newer versions of emacs for Xwindows allow mouse drag and
highlighting features.

In any case, the editor must be aware of the button press simulation via
escape sequences. For Emacs, this means that keymaps have been set up
with specific actions, in short, someone has to write the elisp source
to process the escape sequences. Ditto for JOVE, QEDIT, JED and similar
extensible editors. Non-extensible editors have to be extended and
recompiled.

A way to understand /A3 is to imagine each button press resulting in the
transmission of a string, like "HELLO," for button 1, " WORLD." for
button 2 and " BITTER" for button 3. Then pressing button 1, button 2
and button 3 gives "HELLO, WORLD. BITTER" whereas DRAG on button 1
followed by button 2 gives "HELLO, BITTER WORLD.". (During testing, the
ASM code was modified to do something similar, to allow tracing of
escape sequences.)


LINUX MOUSE DAEMONS.
The analog of xPC-Mouse exists for use under Linux as programs called
"selection" and "gpm". These Unix daemons operate in terminal mode and
provide the same services as xPC-Mouse. The catch is that you have to be
at the console to make them work. They don't work remotely and they
don't work in Xwindows (in fact, they can conflict with X).

PASTE BUFFER.
The paste buffer has space for 2048 characters (2048 is the default; set
a different value with /B). The last part is discarded if the selection
is too large. Blanks at the end of a line are discarded. After the last
non-blank of a line xPC-Mouse inserts a CR char to simulate pressing
ENTER. Control characters with ASCII values below 32 are not stored in
the buffer (they are discarded). The format of the paste buffer agrees
with the format acceptable to Win 3.1 in its clipboard.

Dynamic buffer sizing /Bdddd allows sizing of the paste buffer from 0
bytes to 4096 bytes, where dddd is the decimal (base 10) value in bytes,
assumed to be divisible by 16. For example, /B3070 means buffer size
3072 bytes.

To increase the maximum size of the paste buffer, change the text
"BUFFERLEN EQU 4096" in the ASM source to a larger number like 8192 and
recompile. The EXE file size will not change, but the load size of the
EXE will increase. If you have "loadhigh" in the file autoexec.bat, then
this could break the boot process, by running out of high memory during
boot.

Stuffing of the paste buffer into the keyboard buffer is done by testing
for sufficient space prior to stuffing the character. Ditto for stuffing
cursor keys and Xterm escapes.


HOT BUTTON.
XPCmouse has a button combination to re-install it in case an exiting
program leaves the exit undetectable via interrupt 21h (like a CPM-style
jump to address zero). The combination works through the timer
interrupt, which happens only 18 times per second. Because of the slow
pace, we count the number of times that the combination

                    Ctrl + Left shift + Right Shift

is detected, and wait for 20 times in a row. That's about 1 second. When
this state is detected, then a re-install is scheduled.

The RSHIFT key resets a timer when pressed all by itself. We suggest
doing this for 1/10 second prior to trying the above re-install
sequence.

It is possible to use this hot button in an unusual way, eg, to kill the
active mouse program and install xPCmouse instead. This can be done in
commercial programs, like Word Perfect, Borland C, and Quattro Pro.

Re-installation of the mouse into an active WP session can be done
by a shell to DOS. Borland C and Quattro Pro are not so clever.
A word of warning: WP 6.0 in text mode exits with video errors on
some machines, which can only be reset by the DOS command "mode co80".
If the xPCmouse cursor vanishes after a WP exit, then expect this error.

INTERRUPTS.
Program xPC-Mouse hooks interrupts 10h, 08h, 13h, 21h and 16h. We
explain each one.

Int 10h is hooked to de-select a selected screen region every time a
 program calls int 10h. The decision is made by a code segment variable,
 which records whether or not a screen segment has been highlighted.

Int 08h is hooked to stuff the keyboard buffer on every timer tick, 18.2
 per second. This patch affects the pastebuffer and methods /A1, /A2 and
 /A3. The overhead of this patch is low because almost all the keybuffer
 stuffing gets done by calls to int 10h.

 A second function of int 08h is to re-install the mouse handler on
 request. The requests come from program starts and exits, a command
 line /R or a hot button sequence.

 I did a speed test on the code by running a benchmark with xpcmouse
 loaded and also unloaded. The benchmark in each case ran in the same
 time (accurate to 0.1 seconds in 60 seconds). Finally, I altered the
 routine "HouseKeeping" to emit a BELL when entered and then did a lot
 of operations with the mouse to get an idea of how often the house
 keeping duties happened. Basically, nothing happens when the mouse is
 idle or when the mouse is moved. It takes a mouse button click to
 invoke the house keeping functions. My conclusion is that the int 08h
 overhead is negligible.

 Programs that avoid interrupt 10h, such as some ASM applications that
 do low-level video access, have to rely entirely on timer 08h to stuff
 the keyboard. These programs can be identified by the fact that the
 mouse cursor is always ON and highlighted screen areas do not get
 erased.

Int 13h is for the disk. When the disk is being accessed, it is a bad
 idea to request file opens and writes. We hook this interrupt to get
 information about disk only, and use the resulting flag to avoid
 writing to the disk at the wrong moment. Only used if the compile
 included paste functions and the append file functions.

Int 16h is hooked to get a new function 80h that xPC-Mouse uses to see
 if it is already installed. This function modifies register AH by
 decrementing it. It returns in BX the offset of the paste buffer and in
 ES the segment of the paste buffer.

 The second job of interrupt 16h is to stuff characters into the
 keybuffer. This is done to speed the injection of characters into a
 program, because programs generally write to the screen and read
 characters from the keyboard.

 Ralf Brown suggests that conflicts can occur with any particular choice
 of a function for interrupt 16h. The proper procedure discussed by Ralf
 won't work with xPCmouse, because a rerun of xpcmouse has to be able to
 inquire with int 16h to find the address of the paste buffer.

Int 2fh is used in the program to detect the presence of Win 3.1 and to
 issue clipboard commands to windows. It is not modified in xPC-Mouse.

Int 21h is patched in order to keep xPC-Mouse alive after each program
 start or exit. The only int 21h functions affected are 00h (exit), 4ch
 (exit) and 4b00h (execute program). The patch only sets flags, no
 actual re-install occurs within the interrupt call.

 When a program is executed, int 21h, function 4bh is called, at which
 time the flag is set. The re-install of the mouse handler happens in
 the timer interrupt (18 per second).

 When a program exits, int 21h, functions 00h or 4ch, then a flag is
 set. The actual re-install takes place on the next timer click after
 exit, via interrupt 08h.

 There are flags set by /N0, /N1, /N2 and /N3 to turn these features on
 and off in all combinations. The flags can be set on the fly by running
 xpcmouse from the command line.

So xPC-Mouse works at the normal dos prompt and also with dos shells
started within user programs. In particular, xPC-Mouse works with
COMMANDO and WCED command line editors. In these programs, xPC-Mouse
adds cursor positioning on the command line, double-click on file names
and pasting of file names onto the command line at the text cursor
position.


STACKS SETTING.
If your system does not work with xPC-Mouse, then it has been suggested
that you might try the following in CONFIG.SYS:

                              STACKS=9,256

Maybe. This is the Win 95 default. Multiple interrupts can use more
stack space than DOS normally allows. The problem is almost non-existent
in DOS 6 and 7.

Generally, if your system does not work with standard settings, then
something strange is going on with TSRs. Try xpcmouse with a plain
vanilla floppy boot disk. Add TSR programs until you can isolate the
problem.

KEYBOARD INTERRUPTS.
XPCmouse uses them via int 16h. The timer interrupt is also used to
inject characters into the keyboard buffer. And the keyboard buffer is
read by interrupt 16h.

UN-INSTALL.
Use option /u to un-install xPC-Mouse. But this is only possible, if
there is no other TSR loaded after xPC-Mouse that hooks the same int
vectors. If LOADHIGH is used to load xPC-Mouse, then /U works in more
situations, eg, you can shell out of a text editor to kill the TSR.

In use with wced, the commandline editor, it was possible to unload
wced, then xPC-Mouse, then reload them in reverse order. The order is
determined by which application hooks interrupts first.


EXTENDED TEXT MODES.
xPC-Mouse believes an extended text mode to be active if a video mode
with a higher mode number than the highest in standard vga (=13h) is
active and if a text page needs no more than 800h (4096 decimal) bytes.

No mouse driver I know of supports extended text modes, so don't expect
the mouse cursor to cover the entire screen in anything but 24x80 mode.

Perhaps this is a software design error to be blamed on Microsoft. For
example, the DOS command MODE supports 132 columns and 25, 43, 60 lines.
But those modes do not work with any mouse device driver, including
Microsoft's mouse drivers!


MEMORY USAGE.
With arrow key emulation and full size paste buffer the size is 5k.
xPC-Mouse uses 2k for its text buffer, making resident code sizes of 3k
to 5k possible. There is a sizable non-resident portion of xPC-Mouse
that contains error messages, help screens, etc. These are not left in
memory, therefore the disk size of xPC-Mouse does not tell you how much
memory it uses.

  Example: Version 1.2 of xPCmouse uses 5k memory.

  Run Microsoft's program "mem" as follows: mem /m xpcmouse
  The report is 5024 bytes. That's 4.9 kilobytes.

  Change the xPCmouse command line to include "/B0". Then pasting is
  disabled and the resident size reported is 2976 bytes. That's 2.9
  kilobytes. See, however, the notes below about XPCarrow.exe.

CURSOR KEYS ONLY. If you want a program that uses less memory, and are
willing to give up the paste features, then try XPCarrow.exe, which does
cursor key functions only (1.6k resident).

PASTE ONLY. If you want a program that uses less memory, and are willing
to give up the cursor features, then try XPCpaste.exe, which does paste
functions only (4.1k resident = 2.1k code + 2k buffer).

Compilation of these special configurations is done by setting the three
compiler-time equates ENABLECURSOR, ENABLEPASTE and ENABLEFILEAPPEND in
the source file xpcmouse.asm.

On 8086/8088 machines (do know of one still being used?), setting the
variable XT to TRUE will increase memory requirements by 50 bytes.
Getting rid of the ENABLEFILEAPPEND code will expunge the windows paste
and the file append on hot button code to save some additional space:
336 bytes.

Read the notes in XPCMOUSE.ASM about the programs of Vincent Penquerc'h
(penquerc@merlin.enssat.fr). Earlier versions of PCmouse (by Juergen
Weber) did not have the cursor functions of xPC-Mouse, and therefore
they will use about 500 bytes less. Also available is a source package
from Grant Gustafson for cursor only functions, called MOUSE2G. It is
available at http://www.coast.net/simtel/msdos/screen/ in a file with a
similar name. Finally, you could write what you want using the PCmouse,
Mouse2g and xPC-Mouse ASM sources as a guide.

HIGHLIGHTING METHOD.
The selecting of a screen area is indicated by XORing the attribute
bytes with 80, to de-select they are simply XORed again. To use another
value use the /Xddd option. With ddd=0 you get no visible selection.
Value /X119 is recommended for monochrome (same as option /M). Option
/X78 (red highlight) works on a number of machines with cirrus logic
video card.

There are three highlighting methods.

 The first is the Xterm double-click method, which highlights a word on
   double-click of the mouse.

 The second is the Xterm method for highlighting consecutive characters.
   It defaults to whole lines for larger drags of the mouse. The
   highlight will be done by this method, provided the mouse is dragged
   along the same line, or considering the first mouse press as the
   origin, then the mouse is dragged into Quadrants 1,3 or 4 (drag to
   upper right, lower left or lower right).

 The third method is the matrix method for highlighting a rectangle of
   characters. To do it, the mouse button is pressed at the lower right
   of the rectangle and dragged to the upper left corner. The skill is
   easy to learn. A quick lesson: put the mouse in the lower right of
   the screen and drag it to the home position. That highlights the
   maximum rectangle (25x80).

============================ RETURN VALUES ==============================

               0  successfully installed
               1  hardware/software requirements failed
               2  already installed
               3  Help request processed, no operations done


=========================== ERROR MESSAGES ==============================

    xPC-Mouse was already installed.
       Tried to install xPC-Mouse program twice, failure, the program
       will not be installed twice.

    xPC-Mouse was not installed yet.
       Tried to re-install xPC-Mouse, failure, because the program was
       not installed.

    xPC-Mouse is un-installed.
       Successful /U option de-installs xPC-Mouse and frees memory.

    xPC-Mouse is re-activated.
       Successful /R option resets all interrupt vectors and restarts
       the driver.

    Could not un-install xPC-Mouse.
       Unsuccessful /U option, because another TSR program was installed
       after xPC-Mouse, or else something went wrong and address
       conflicts were found.

    No mouse driver found or driver too old.
       The mouse program supplied with the mouse by the manufacturer is
       not installed or else has a very old version with missing mouse
       driver features. Fix: install the driver in config.sys (then
       reboot) or in autoexec.bat (and type the same command line at the
       dos prompt). If you can't find one, then look for "mouse.co_" on
       Windows 3.1 distribution disks. The program EXPAND changes this
       file in Microsoft's "mouse.com". This is not the ideal mouse
       driver, but it works. For better choices, see the documentation
       above on mouse driver "gmouse.com", especially if you want to use
       xPCmouse in a dos box in windows 3.1. For Win 95, the only choice
       is to use Microsoft's mouse driver (it works).

    xPC-Mouse not installed.
       Attempt to install xPC-Mouse in memory failed, due to something
       missing, like the mouse driver, or not enough space, or some
       conflict.

    xPC-Mouse needs at least an 80286 cpu.
       Attempt to install xPC-Mouse in memory failed, because the driver
       was compiled for 286 or better CPU, and this CPU tests out to be
       8088 or 8086. Fix: Compile xpcmouse.asm with symbol XT set to
       TRUE (see the ASM file). Use that xpcmouse.exe instead of the
       present one. NOTE: The version in the distribution was compiled
       for a 286 or better cpu. An XT compile is recommended only in
       case you have a dusty old IBM-PC from the years 1981-1984 (8088
       or 8086 processor). The IBM-AT has a 286 processor.

    Cannot open file.
       A file open for name X was attempted by either the option /F=X or
       the option /D=X. The open failed, for some reason. In the first
       case, it is lack of disk space or a bad file name. In the second
       case, the file is being opened in read-only mode and it was not
       found.

    /F:X error: Name X has a 20 character maximum.
       The file name must fit into a fixed buffer in the resident code
       of size 20 bytes. Use a different name. Or else use the command
       line interface which allows 128 character file names. Sometimes
       the DOS command "subst.exe" can be used to shorten a file name
       into the 20 character limit.

    /F=X error: /F=X allows name X with 128 character maximum.
       A file name was entered which exceeds the 128 character limit.
       Use a shorter name.

    BEEP.
       The bell sounds on certain errors, especially on failure to open
       the TMP file and failures in pasting the text into the windows
       clipboard. Beeps in Windows mean: try again.

============================== PROBLEMS ==================================

A statement from 1983: If I leave Borland's TD386 with 1993 xPC-Mouse
                       1.0 installed it hangs the computer.

  When MSDOS 5.0 came out Borland had to distribute a patch for TD386
  because then the same problem occurred. So this seems to be not
  xPC-Mouse 1.0's problem but TD386's. (1993 documentation)

  1997 update. Maybe... The bug fixes for version 1.1 suggest that the
  problem might have been the interrupt 21h patch. The changes in
  xPC-Mouse 1.1 may make this problem go away. I tried to make TD386
  hang on exit, but it would not happen with versions 1.1 or 1.2. In
  fact, xPC-Mouse stayed alive on exit, using only the /N1 command line
  switch.

A statement from 1993: It has been reported that xPC-Mouse did not find
                       the mouse driver.

  This happens with some old mouse drivers. To solve this problem
  install a new mouse driver. A new mouse driver can be found on the Win
  3.1 disks (mouse.co_ becomes mouse.com via EXPAND.EXE). See also the
  recommended driver list above, especially "gmouse.com", available from
  the WWW site (Jan 1997)

=========================== KERMIT and RZ/SZ ===========================

The use of xPC-Mouse with Kermit has been tested. There are many
"gotchas" in using this interface with a remote Unix system or remote
DOS system. The easiest interface is the default /A1. Try it first, then
the others.

This information is current in January 1998. Directory locations and FTP
sites change with time.

To get a copy of MS Kermit 3.13 or later, use anonymous FTP to
watsun.cc.columbia.edu. Hunt for the right ZIP file and download to your
system. You can get it with Netscape or Lynx browsers using URL

                       ftp://ftp.cc.columbia.edu/

Also recommended for fast uploads and downloads is SZ/RZ, invoked by
program DSZ.COM from Omen Technology INC. The shareware version is
available from www.coast.net, in directory SimTel/msdos/zmodem. Use a
mirror site during peak hours, eg, www.cdrom.com and www.simtel.net.
